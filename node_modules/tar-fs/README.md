## Usage

tar-fs allows you to pack directories into tarballs and extract tarballs into directories.

It doesn't gunzip for you, so if you want to extract a `.tar.gz` with this you'll need to use something like [gunzip-maybe](https://github.com/mafintosh/gunzip-maybe) in addition to this.

``` js
var tar = require('tar-fs')
var fs = require('fs')

// packing a directory
tar.pack('./my-directory').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('my-tarball.tar'))

// extracting a directory
fs.createReadStream('my-other-tarball.tar').pipe(tar.extract('./my-other-directory'))
```

To ignore various files when packing or extracting add a ignore function to the options. `ignore`
is also an alias for `filter`. Additionally you get `header` if you use ignore while extracting.
That way you could also filter by metad
